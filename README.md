# Bank-Managment-System

Hello everyone ! I am feeling happy to share that with you all that I have developed:
A University Management System app developed with Core Java, JDBC, and MySQL streamlines student, faculty, and administrative tasks. Utilizing Java's object-oriented approach, it models users, courses, grades, and schedules. JDBC facilitates database connectivity, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation. MySQL serves as the backend database for secure storage of information. The app features student enrollment, course registration, grade management, and administrative functionalities. Error handling mechanisms ensure smooth operation, while modular design allows for scalability and maintenance. Comprehensive documentation aids in usage and development, while continuous testing ensures reliability. Integration with other university systems fosters seamless data exchange and interoperability.
As a minor project.....
